dynpy [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/artemyk/dynpy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/artemyk/dynpy)
=====

dynpy is a framework for building dynamical systems in Python.  So far, it has basic support for linear dynamical systems, random walkers, Boolean Networks, and Cellular Autamata.

For documentation, see http://dynpy.readthedocs.org/ .  The tutorial, at http://dynpy.readthedocs.org/tutorial.html , may be particularly helpful.


Installation
------------
Just download into a directory and do
```
python setup.py install
```

dynpy requires numpy and scipy.  Testing requires nose and coverage.  Building the documentation requires matplotlib.
