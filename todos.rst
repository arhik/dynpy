A list of TODOs
===============

* Look for ``TODO`` in code
* Look for ``TODOTEST`` in code -- need to write tests for this
* Optimize code, need a heavy test case for this
* Document
* Code for marginalization (ie, projecting multivariate system to subspace)
* Ensembles of random BNs (perhaps use slots to minimize memory overhead)
* Take a look at https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyDSTool
* For linear systems, implement laplacian, normalized laplacian of state-transition graph
* Make sure getTrajectory returns sparse matrix in sparse case
