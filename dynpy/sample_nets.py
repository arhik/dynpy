"""This module provides several sample networks and dynamical systems for use
in testing and development.

Right now it includes:

``yeast_cellcycle_bn``: A 11-node yeast-cell cycle Boolean network.  It is in
the 'truthtable' format. For more details, see Li et al, The yeast cell-cycle 
network is robustly designed, PNAS, 2004.

``karateclub_net``: A 34-node graph representing Zachary's karate-club network.
It is in numpy array format.

``test_bn``: A simple 4-node BN for testing

``test2_bn``: Another simple 4-node BN for testing
